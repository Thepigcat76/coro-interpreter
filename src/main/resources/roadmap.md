  Source Code: The source code is the written program in a high-level language that is intended to be executed by the interpreter.

  Lexer/Tokenizer: The lexer (or tokenizer) analyzes the source code and breaks it down into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and punctuation marks.

  Parser: The parser processes the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and constructs a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST). It checks the syntax of the program and enforces the language's grammar rules.

  Semantic Analyzer: The semantic analyzer performs a deeper analysis of the program beyond syntax. It checks the program's semantics, including type checking, scope analysis, and name resolution, to ensure it follows the language's rules and constraints.

  Symbol Table: The symbol table is a data structure that stores information about variables, functions, classes, and other symbols in the program. It keeps track of their names, types, scope, and other relevant details. The symbol table is used during the semantic analysis phase to resolve identifiers and enforce scope rules.

  Intermediate Representation (IR): The intermediate representation (IR) is an abstract representation of the code that is easier to analyze and optimize than the original source code. It may be generated from the AST and can be used for various purposes, such as code optimization, execution, or generating machine code.

  Interpreter/Executor: The interpreter (or executor) is responsible for executing the program. It traverses the AST or IR, interprets the program step by step, and performs the required operations, following the control flow and applying the semantics of the programming language.

  Runtime Environment: The runtime environment provides the necessary infrastructure for executing the program. It includes memory allocation, variable storage, function invocation mechanisms, I/O operations, and other resources needed for the program's execution.

  I/O Subsystem: The I/O subsystem handles input and output operations for the program. It allows the program to interact with the external world, read input from the user, write output to the console or files, and perform other I/O-related tasks.

  Error Handling and Reporting: The interpreter needs to handle and report errors encountered during the execution of the program. It includes detecting syntax errors, semantic errors, runtime errors, and providing appropriate error messages or exceptions.

  Standard Library: The standard library consists of pre-built modules and functions that provide a range of common functionalities and utilities to the programmer. It allows developers to leverage ready-to-use code for tasks like string manipulation, mathematical operations, file I/O, and more.
